# 💡 Multi-Domain Learning Project: Hardware, Firmware & Software

Welcome to this project that combines **hardware design**, **embedded firmware**, and **application-level software**. The project is a portable weather station that gets temperature, humidity, pressure and show on a dashboard.

## 🧭 Project Goal

This is a personal project for me to learning all aspects of an embedded system project that involves:

- 🔧 **Hardware**: Circuit design, schematics, and PCB development
- 🧠 **Firmware**: Embedded code for microcontrollers, in this case ESP32
- 💻 **Software**: Applications that interact with the device, including dashboards and data logging

The objective is to **understand how these layers connect**, and how to manage a multidisciplinary project effectively.

## 📌 What I'm learning

- Designing a hardware system using open-source tools
- Writing low-level embedded firmware to read sensors and communicate
- Creating software tools to visualize and log the collected data
- Managing a complete project in a clean and modular way

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a learning project. Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or ask questions. The goal is to learn collaboratively.

I'm not the best at programming and this project is also for me to improve my ability in writing code.
