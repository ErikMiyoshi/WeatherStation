# ‚öôÔ∏è Firmware for Learning Project

This folder contains the embedded firmware code that runs on the microcontroller, handling sensor data acquisition, device control, and communication with other systems.

## üéØ Purpose

The firmware aims to provide hands-on experience with:

- Writing low-level code for microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32)
- Interfacing sensors and peripherals
- Managing communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, UART, I2C, SPI)
- Implementing power management and device states
- Organizing firmware code for maintainability and scalability

---

## üõ† Development Environment

- **Platform:** ESP-IDF 
- **Languages:** C / C++  
- **Toolchain:** GCC-based toolchains, ESP-IDF tools
- **Flashing:** Using tools like `idf.py`, `esptool.py`, or vendor-specific utilities

I also have another repository [ESP32_Basic_Projects](https://github.com/ErikMiyoshi/ESP32_Basic_Projects) that I write basic examples with each submodule of the device (sensors, displays, wifi, etc.) to test each part individually
